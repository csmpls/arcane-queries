THE FOOL - Everyman
The Fool represents human nature with all its strengths and weaknesses in a state of innocence.   He is supported by his dog for good or ill.
Idea, thought, spirituallity, that which endeavors to rise above the material (if the subject which is enquired about be spiritual).  If the Divination refers to a material event of ordinary life, this card is not good, and shows folly, stupidity, eccentricity and even mania, unless offset by very good cards.
Listen to your wiser self.  This card alerts you to your weaknesses and stresses that self-awareness is the key to psychological and spiritual wholeness.  It urges you to think twice: thoughtless action leads to regrets.  Immature behaviour, folly and indescretion will cause difficulty in any sphere of your life.  If you are at the outset of a new project, you should examine the situation closely.  Perhaps you have been viewing it through rose-colored spectacles?
It is too ideal and unstable to be generally good in material things.

THE MAGICIAN - Skill, adaptability
Skill, wisdom,adaptation.  Craft, cunning, etc.
The Magician presides over all the suits of the Minor Arcana and may call on them to further his own progress and development.  His hat bears a horizontal representation of the figure 8 - the figure attributed to Hermes in occultism.  The Magician is original, creative and flexible but he is also very cunning and capable of manipulating others for good or ill.
This card suggests that you should not be apprehensive about taking positive and determined action.  Weakness of will and an unoriginal approach will impede progress.  You are in a strong position to influence others; be compassionate but forceful.
Always depending on neighboring cards.  Sometimes occult wisdom.

THE HIGH PRIESTESS - Discrimination
Change, alteration, increase and decrease. Fluctuation, whether for good or evil, is shown by cards connected with it.  (Compare with DEATH and THE MOON).
Quintessentially feminine, the High Priestess poses a challenge to masculine dominance.  She is usually shown reading a book and her expression is calm - but does her composure merely serve to mask her emotions?
The High Priestess symbolizes wisdom.  She is willing to share her knowledge with others and advises introspection.  Listen to what others have to say but analyse it carefully.  Be organized and discreet; hidden influences may be at work.  Let intuition and your positive emotional responses guide you.  The High Priestess also has a bearing on health and diet and is perhaps urging you to review these two areas of your life.
